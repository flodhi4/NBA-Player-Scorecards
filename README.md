# NBA-Player-Scorecards
The goal is to make NBA data easily accessible by means of a player scorecard that contains key indicators of an individual's proficiency in several different metrics. In Pandas, using player totals, advanced, play-by-play, and shooting data from basketball-reference (https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_totals.html), calculating additional metrics such as Per 48, Per MP, and shot volume from each distance. Finally, calculated key metrics as percentile ranks to represent all numbers relative to the field. 

For the average user, these scorecards can be viewed as an emulation of "game ratings". To elaborate - in sports video games, each attribute for each player is rated on a scale from 0-99, and then a player is given an overall rating. The league's best shooters, for example, would have a 99 3PT rating, while other players may have a 80 Dunk rating, and, say, a 75 overall rating.

By representing all values in the scorecard as a percentile rank, we have effectively put together a 0-100 scale, essentially mirroring how game ratings work. In the example below, we could say that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has a 75 3PT 'rating', when in reality it means that he is in the 75th percentile in the league for 3PT shots made.

After using Pandas to clean and manipulate the data, the below visualization was created in PowerBI.
